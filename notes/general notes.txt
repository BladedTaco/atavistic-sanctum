if someone is on a ledge, other people can't grab it. (ledge guarding)
if someone is on a ledge, they can be grabbed off and air-thrown in any direction
a downward air-throw is like a footstool, and takes a jump from the thrown
air-throws have mostly fixed knockback, only scaling with rage
breaking shields increases the damage and knockback of the move used to break it.
Damage taken decreases as percentage goes up, while damage dealt increases
Knockback taken increases as percentage goes up, while knocback dealt stays constant
air dodges give momentum and are refreshed by an air-jump
mac gets his air dodge back from using his recovery
no wall jumps
mac's up b can hit a wall to give it back once

each character has a small sweet-hurtbox and some attacks have a small sweetspot,
a "sweetspot attack" is done whenever the hitbox and hurtbox collide. All other cases is a sourspot

maybe speed up all attacks.

Add a small input buffer, maybe 6-frames. Nothing can be buffered other than what is in this buffer

hit animations are done for up, backwards, and downwards; the up animation is also a weak hit animation
